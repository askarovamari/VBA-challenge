- Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

1. The ticker symbol

2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

4. The total stock volume of the stock. 



- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

The result should match the following:
